/// Possible transaction statuses returned from our [`TransactionProgress::next_item()`] call.
///
/// These status events can be grouped based on their kinds as:
///
/// 1. Entering/Moving within the pool:
///    - `Future`
///    - `Ready`
/// 2. Inside `Ready` queue:
///    - `Broadcast`
/// 3. Leaving the pool:
///    - `InBlock`
///    - `Invalid`
///    - `Usurped`
///    - `Dropped`
/// 4. Re-entering the pool:
///    - `Retracted`
/// 5. Block finalized:
///    - `Finalized`
///    - `FinalityTimeout`
///
/// The events will always be received in the order described above, however
/// there might be cases where transactions alternate between `Future` and `Ready`
/// pool, and are `Broadcast` in the meantime.
///
/// Note that there are conditions that may cause transactions to reappear in the pool:
///
/// 1. Due to possible forks, the transaction that ends up being included
///    in one block may later re-enter the pool or be marked as invalid.
/// 2. A transaction that is `Dropped` at one point may later re-enter the pool if
///    some other transactions are removed.
/// 3. `Invalid` transactions may become valid at some point in the future.
///    (Note that runtimes are encouraged to use `UnknownValidity` to inform the
///    pool about such cases).
/// 4. `Retracted` transactions might be included in a future block.
///
/// The stream is considered finished only when either the `Finalized` or `FinalityTimeout`
/// event is triggered. You are however free to unsubscribe from notifications at any point.
/// The first one will be emitted when the block in which the transaction was included gets
/// finalized. The `FinalityTimeout` event will be emitted when the block did not reach finality
/// within 512 blocks. This either indicates that finality is not available for your chain,
